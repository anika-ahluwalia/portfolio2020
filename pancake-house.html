                    <p>I chose to redesign the website of one of my favorite restaurants in my hometown.</p> 
                    <p>The Original Pancake House is a well known national franchise with over 100 locations nationwide, 
                    so I expected their website to be very fleshed out and put together.</p> <p>I was shocked to find that it was quite 
                        difficult to use and interpret. I decided to redesign this website and began by identifying usability 
                        and accessibility problems.</p>

                <h2 class="accent">Usability Problems</h2>
                <p> I began by idenfying design problems in four main areas; usability, memorability, learnability, and efficiency. My findings are summarized here:</p>
                <div class="prob-container row align-items-top justify-content-center">
                  <div class="problem1 col-lg-3 col-xs-12">
                    <h2 class="text-center" style="padding-bottom: 12px;">Usability</h2>
                    <div>
                      <ul>High contrast colors (all bright primary colors) and strange grouping can overwhelm the user when they first look at it</ul>
                      <ul>No adaptabilities for different sizes of screens and does not resize well</ul>
                      <ul>Too many different typefaces and layout styles confuse the user</ul>
                    </div>
                  </div>
          
                  <div class="problem1 col-lg-3 col-xs-12">
                    <h2 class="text-center" style="padding-bottom: 12px;">Memorability</h2>
                    <div>
                      <ul>Hard to interpret information because it is not grouped or clearly sectioned</ul>
                      <ul>The cluttered top contrasted with the excess white space towards the end of the webpage overwhelms and confuses the user</ul>
                      <ul>There isn't any one element (name, logo, slogan) that clearly stands out to the user when they first look at the page</ul>
                    </div>
                  </div>
          
                  <div class="problem1 col-lg-3 col-xs-12">
                    <h2 class="text-center" style="padding-bottom: 12px;">Learnability</h2>
                    <div>
                      <ul>Inconsistent use of typefaces makes it difficult to comprehend the content and see the hierarchy</ul>
                      <ul>Lots of long descriptions with only two (bad quality) images makes it hard to remember and interpret information</ul>
                      <ul>The lack of a clear hierarchy makes it difficult to to know which information is being presented on the page and where to look for it</ul>
                    </div>
                  </div>
          
                  <div class="col-lg-3 col-xs-12">
                    <h2 class="text-center" style="padding-bottom: 12px;">Efficiency</h2>
                    <div>
                      <ul>Lots of repetition in content across the different pages of the website which could confuse the user on where to look</ul>
                      <ul>Confusing to nagivate the webpage because there is a top menu and a left menu</ul>
                      <ul>Inconsistent and uneven spacing between elements and too much white space makes it hard to look for information</ul>
                    </div>

          <div class="section">
            <h2><span class="accent">Lo-fi Wireframes</span></h2>
            <p>I moved on by creating simple wireframe prototypes of a potential new interface for the homepage of this website. 
                I tried to remedy many of the design issues I identified above. For example, I established 
                clear sections and grouped information into these sections so that the webpage would be easier to read and parse. More information on how I chose to fix the issues that were identified
                can be found directly on the prototypes themselves. </p> <p> The lofi prototypes are a rough first look of the structure of 
                the webpage with placeholders for many of the elements. I created these prototypes in three different screen sizes
                (website, tablet, and mobile) to better demonstrate how the page will adapt as the screen size shrinks and grows. </p>

                <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FX8wUvdlZDrbbpOrh4xiYUX%2FPancake-House%3Fnode-id%3D71%253A0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

          <div class="section">
            <h2><span class="accent">Hi-fi Prototypes</span></h2>
            <p>Once I finished these lofi prototypes, I moved onto creating more high fidelity prototypes that would 
                illustrate how these designs could be turned into an actual webpage. These were based off of the structure 
                outlined in the lofi prototypes, but I filled in many of the missing elements and added important stylistic
                choicse. In these prototypes, I annotated 
                significant design choices and their implementation so that they could be easily translated into a real
                webpage by any designer. Similar to the lofi prototypes, I created three screen size mockups. </p>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
                <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FX8wUvdlZDrbbpOrh4xiYUX%2FPancake-House%3Fnode-id%3D0%253A1" allowfullscreen></iframe>

          </div>

          <div class="section">
            <h2><span class="accent">Style Guide</span></h2>
            <p>Next, I created a style guide to reflect the design choices and interactive states in my design.
                This design guide serves as a useful tool for both myself and other potential designs. It ensures
                that I remain consistent in my implementation and designs and that there is a unified and coherent 
                experience in the webpage, but it also is useful because it would allow any other designer to "pick up 
                where I left off" and redesign other pages of the website using a similar style to the redesigned 
                homepage. </p>
            <div class="d-flex justify-content-center">
                <iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Ffile%2FX8wUvdlZDrbbpOrh4xiYUX%2FPancake-House%3Fnode-id%3D12%253A91" allowfullscreen></iframe>

                </div>          
              </div>
            <p>In the end, I found this project to be really fun and rewarding! It was great to examine
                an existing website and to be able to critique it based on usability principles. I loved thinking about how I could improve this website
                on my own and how I would organize the information that it presented. Ultimately, the website that I 
                created ended up being more responsive than the original and made adjustments for smaller screen sizes that made
                it usable on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices. </p>
