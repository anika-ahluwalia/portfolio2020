            <h2><span class="accent">Introduction</span></h2>
            <p>
                In order to become more comfortable with React, I decided to create a website that would allow 
                a user to aggregate their favorite songs into a playlist. This webpage would also include functionality
                that would allow the user to filter and sort their list of songs that could be added to the playlist.
              </p>
              <p>
                The goal of this project was to gain familiarity with React and web development, while still creating
                a useful application. This application draws inspiration from my favorite music streaming service,
                Spotify. While Spofity allows users to easily search through their liked songs by either title, artist, 
                or genre, there is no easy way to filter all of these specifications 
                at once. Personally, when I go to create a playlist in the software, I find myself endlessly scrolling
                through my list of 500+ liked songs until I stumble on the select few that fit the mood that I am
                attempting to achieve for this playlist.
              </p>
              <p>
                Thus, this design attempts to remedy this shortcoming and demonstrate a concept of streamlined browsing for 
                songs. While users retain the ability to search for their desired songs, they can filter these results
                in ways that may be helpful when creating their playlists. For example, users can filter songs based on
                mood and genre which may be helpful when creating a playlist of similar songs. They can also sort their
                songs based on the length and rating of the song, which could streamline their browsing as well.

                <h2 class="accent">Usability Principles</h2>
                <p> I began by considering the usability principles that I wanted to incorporate into my application:</p>
                <div class="prob-container row align-items-top justify-content-center">
                  <div class="problem1 col-lg-3 col-xs-12">

                    <div>
                        <ul>Actionable components are clearly separated (button and text enter UI).</ul>
                        <ul>Responsive to resizes in the screen size.</ul>
                    </div>
                  </div>
          
                  <div class="problem1 col-lg-3 col-xs-12">
                    <h2 class="text-center" style="padding-bottom: 12px;">Memorability</h2>
                    <div>
                        <ul>Action buttons have the same format everywhere.</ul>
                        <ul>All cards include the same information in similar displays and have the same information hierarchy.</ul>
                    </div>
                  </div>
          
                  <div class="problem1 col-lg-3 col-xs-12">
                    <h2 class="text-center" style="padding-bottom: 12px;">Learnability</h2>
                    <div>
                        <ul>Action buttons cause immediate visual changes that can easily be reverted.</ul>
                    </div>
                  </div>
          
                  <div class="col-lg-3 col-xs-12">

                    <div>
                        <ul>Filtering and sorting allows users to enrich their browsing experience.</ul>

                </div>

          <div class="section align-items-center justify-content-center">

            <p>In the end, this project was really valuable for a variety of reasons. Firstly,
                it allowed me to learn more about using React and JavaScript and gave me valuable
                skills in that area. It also helped me understand how to filter and sort items, and
                how many of JavaScript's important functionalities work. Finally, it gave me the chance
                to think outside the box and create a fun variation on one of my favorite applications.
                It allowd me, as a user, to think about what I wanted, and then I was able to 
                switch into a developer role and think about how I would implement it.
